// THIS IS THE ONLY FILE YOU NEED TO UPDATE EACH WEEK.
//
// To update stats:
//   1. Upload new MaxPreps PDFs to Claude
//   2. Claude replaces the batters[] and pitchers[] arrays below
//   3. Also update team records in the standings/teams objects if needed
//   4. Update DATA_UPDATED below to today's date
//   5. Replace this file in GitHub → Vercel auto-deploys
//
// DO NOT edit stats.html, standings.html, teams.html, or index.html
// unless you're changing the site layout/design.
